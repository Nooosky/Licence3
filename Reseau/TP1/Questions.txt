Q2- pstree affiche les processus en cours d'execution sous la forme d'un arbre.
De plus, "3*[{at-spi-bus-laun}]" signifie que le processus at-spi-bus-laun utilise 3 threads.

On peut utiliser ps -aux
Les differents etats d'un processus sont (selon man ps) :
       - D    uninterruptible sleep (usually IO)
       - R    running or runnable (on run queue)
       - S    interruptible sleep (waiting for an event to complete)
       - T    stopped, either by a job control signal or because it is being traced.
       - W    paging (not valid since the 2.6.xx kernel)
       - X    dead (should never be seen)
       - Z    defunct ("zombie") process, terminated but not reaped by its parent.

       For BSD formats and when the stat keyword is used, additional characters may be displayed:
       - <    high-priority (not nice to other users)
       - N    low-priority (nice to other users)
       - L    has pages locked into memory (for real-time and custom IO)
       - s    is a session leader
       - l    is multi-threaded (using CLONE_THREAD, like NPTL pthreads do)
       - +    is in the foreground process group.
